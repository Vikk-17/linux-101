Basic syntax of while loop:

while [ exp1 ]; do
    commands
    more commands
done

while [ exp1 ]; do commands; done

C language form:

(( exp1 ))
while (( exp2 )); do
    commands
    (( exp3 ))
done

Breaking out of a loop: 
Bash provides two built in commands that can be used to control program
flow inside loops. The <"break"> command immediately terminates a loop, and program control resumes 
with the next statement following a loop. The <"continue"> command causes the remainder of the loop
to be skipped, and program control resumes with the next iteration.


until loop:
The until compund command is much like while, except instead of exiting a loop when a non-zero exit
status is encountered, it does the opposite. An until loop continues until it receives a zero exit
status.
